# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## The Future of AI in the Physical World

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This course introduces **Physical AI**—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. You'll learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions.

## Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to **embodied intelligence** that operates in physical space.

## What You'll Learn

Throughout this course, you will:

- ✅ Understand Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence
- ✅ Master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for robotic control
- ✅ Simulate robots with Gazebo and Unity
- ✅ Develop with NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform
- ✅ Design humanoid robots for natural interactions
- ✅ Integrate GPT models for conversational robotics

## Course Structure

The course is divided into four comprehensive modules:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
Learn the middleware that powers modern robots. Understand how ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services work together to create intelligent robotic systems.

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
Master physics simulation and environment building. Create realistic simulations that mirror real-world physics.

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
Explore advanced perception and training using NVIDIA's cutting-edge robotics platform.

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
Discover the convergence of Large Language Models and Robotics. Build robots that understand and execute natural language commands.

## Capstone Project

Your journey culminates in building **The Autonomous Humanoid**—a simulated robot that:
- Receives voice commands
- Plans optimal paths
- Navigates obstacles
- Identifies objects using computer vision
- Manipulates objects in the environment

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Understanding of fundamental AI/ML concepts
- Enthusiasm for robotics and physical AI!

## Let's Begin!

The future of work will be a partnership between people, intelligent agents (AI software), and robots. This shift won't necessarily eliminate jobs but will change what humans do, leading to a massive demand for new skills.

Are you ready to be part of this revolution? Let's dive in! 🚀
