# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)



## The Convergence of LLMs and Robotics

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent the cutting edge: AI systems that can **see**, **understand language**, and **take action** in the physical world.

## Voice-to-Action Pipeline

### 1. Speech Recognition with Whisper
### 2. Cognitive Planning with LLMs
### 3. Vision Processing
### 4. Action Execution

## Complete VLA System

Integrate voice, vision, and action for autonomous robots that understand natural language commands.

## Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid

Build a robot that:
1. ✅ Receives voice commands
2. ✅ Plans with GPT-4
3. ✅ Navigates with Nav2
4. ✅ Detects objects with YOLO
5. ✅ Manipulates in Isaac Sim

## Congratulations! 🎉
